## Overview
In this course project there are given 4 plots we need to reconstruct. Requirements and the original plots can be found here [https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1).   

This repository basically consists of four PNG files (`plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.) and their corrsepsonding R scripts to make this plots (`plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, etc.)


## Dataset
Original Data set can be found here [Electric power consumption](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip). It consists of 'measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years'.   

Data used for plotting is only two days (2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02).
